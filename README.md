# miscellaneous-projects
Projects to automate stuff, among other things!

Everything in this project comes from miscellaneous code I have written over the years. See the descriptions below. All of it is available under the GNU license - feel free to use or modify!

1. grade_project.ipynb : This code reads the student submissions in a spreadsheet and compares the numbers against a solution spreadsheet. Both the spreadsheet were in excel format, but can be easily changed to any pandas supported format.
